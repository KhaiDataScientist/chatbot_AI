## Introduction
In this project I created a website where you can have a conversation with a chatbot and it will provide for you some useful information related to mental health.

## Features
In the website, there are several functionalities:
- Community: where you can share your posts or your stories about mental health 
- Chatbot: chat with chatbot about mental health
## Set up

The first thing to do is to clone the repository. In your terminal, type this command

```sh
$ mkdir chatbot_project
$ cd chatbot_project
$ git clone https://github.com/KhaiDataScientist/chatbot_AI.git
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ pip install virtualenv
$ python<version> -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
